        <ul class="questions">
            <li><strong>Does this work on my phone?</strong><br />
                %ergarcade% requires a computer that is connected to your ergometer(s)
                via USB cable. Once this is in place, you are able to use your mobile
                device as a %remote-viewer%. Be aware that the graphical nature of the
                %visualisations% and %games% on %ergarcade% will result in fast draining
                of your device's battery, and you may experience performance or
                rendering issues.

        <ul class="questions">
            <li><strong>Why do I need to install the %c2proxy% on my computer?</strong><br />
                The %c2proxy% acts as the middle-man between your ergometer and computer.
                It translates the information from all connected ergometers and relays it
                to your web browser running an %ergarcade% tool, visualisation or game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>I've downloaded and installed the %c2proxy%. What now?</strong><br />
                The %c2proxy% icon will appear in your computers' system tray; click on that and
                a menu will appear. Click on <strong>Launch browser</strong> and choose from
                the list of %tools%, %visualisations% or %games%.
            </li>

            <li><strong>I have a Windows computer. Does %ergarcade% work on it?</strong><br />
                Windows support for %c2proxy% is on the %roadmap% and will be completed soon.

        <ul class="questions">
            <li><strong>What ergometers can I use with %ergarcade%?</strong><br />
                The %concept2% indoor rowing ergometer, SkiErg and BikeErg are supported.
            </li>

            <li><strong>My ergometer doesn't have a square-ish USB connector. Can I use
                    %ergarcade%?</strong><br />
                The PM3, PM4 and PM5 %performance-monitor%s are supported for use with %ergarcade%
                via USB cable only. PM1 and PM2 are not supported.
            </li>

            <li><strong>My gym uses blue / yellow cables to connect all their ergometers.
                    Can I use %ergarcade% in this environment?</strong><br />
                Your gym connects their machines in a <strong>RS485</strong> network. This
                configuration is unsupported by the %c2proxy% but it
                <strong><u>is</u></strong> on the %roadmap%! Keep an eye on the
                %facebook%, %instagram% and %googlegroups% pages for updates.

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <ul class="questions">
            <li><strong>Will all the applications work on my computer?</strong><br />
                All the %applications% on the %ergarcade% run in your browser.
                They have all been tested on the <a
                href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome browser</a>
                but should also work on Safari.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Some applications run slowly!</strong><br />
                Performance will vary depending on the specifications of your
                computer.  Older machines will not run as well as more recent
                computers, and amount of RAM and CPU speed will also affect
                performance.<br /><br /> Most applications will include
                settings for varying graphical quality or speed; consider
                changing these to lower settings and seeing if that improves
                performance.
