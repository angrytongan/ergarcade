            <li><strong>Why do I need to install the %c2proxy% on my computer?</strong><br />
                The %c2proxy% acts as the middle-man between your ergometer and computer.
                It translates the information from all connected ergometers and relays it
                to your web browser runinng an %ergarcade% tool, visualisation or game.
            </li>

            <li><strong>I've downloaded and installed the %c2proxy%. What now?</strong><br />
                The %c2proxy% icon will appear in your computers' system tray; click on that and
                a menu will appear. Click on <strong>Launch browser</strong> and choose from
                the list of %tools%, %visualisations% or %games%.
            </li>

            <li><strong>I have a Windows computer. Does %ergarcade% work on it?</strong><br />
                Windows support for %c2proxy% is on the %roadmap% and will be completed soon.

        <ul class="questions">
            <li><strong>What ergometers can I use with %ergarcade%?</strong><br />
                The %concept2% indoor rowing ergometer, SkiErg and BikeErg are supported.
            </li>

            <li><strong>My ergometer doesn't have a square-ish USB connector. Can I use
                    %ergarcade%?</strong><br />
                The PM4 and PM5 %performance-monitor%s are supported for use with %ergarcade%
                via USB cable only. PM1, PM2 and PM3 are not supported.
            </li>

            <li><strong>My gym cables has their ergometers connected to each other with
                    cables. Can I use %ergarcade% in this environment?</strong><br />
                Your gym connects their machines in a <strong>RS485</strong> network. This
                configuration is unsupported by the %c2proxy% but it
                <strong><u>is</u></strong> on the %roadmap%! Keep an eye on the
                %facebook%, %instagram% and %googlegroups% pages for updates.
