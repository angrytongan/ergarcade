    <strong>Dean Fogarty</strong> is a software engineer, %concept2-coach% and
    CrossFit coach based in Brisbane, Australia. He came up with the
    %ergarcade% after deciding the data collected by the %concept2%
    %performance-monitor% could be presented in various forms that would help
    coaches and athletes in real-time.
    </p>

    <p>
    The initial application was %omniscient%, a single web page application
    intended to present views of all athlete's performance monitors simultaneously
    and in real-time. Paired with a tablet, coaches were now able to coach
    individual athletes while watching the data from all athletes without
    leaving the floor.

    <p>
    Visualisations were next, starting with a port of %webgl-fluid-simulation%
    by <a href="https://github.com/PavelDoGreat">Pavel Dobryakov</a>.
    Experiments with the %unity% game engine led to ... and ... games.
    </p>

    <p>
    Dean enjoys coaching the erg, training and coaching CrossFit, and writing
    visualisations for the %ergarcade%. He is very busy as a husband to Shannon
    and father to Thea, Ariel and Atlas.
