    <h1>Welcome to the Erg Arcade!</h1>

    <p>
    The <strong>Erg Arcade</strong> makes training on any of the
    %concept2% ergometers - the indoor rower, the SkiErg or the BikeErg - much more
    enjoyable! Connect your ergometer to your computer and you can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use %tools% to improve your coaching and erging experience;</li>
        <li>Watch groovy %visualisations% while you train; and</li>
        <li>Play some awesome %games%!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Unlike a real arcade, all the applications on the %ergarcade% are free to
    use!
    </p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>What is this, and why do I need it?</h2>
        <p>
        The %concept2% %performance-monitor% (<strong>PM</strong>) collects
        lots of information during an erg session which is useful in the
        context of training for improving health and fitness.  However,
        spending lots of time on the ergometer can be, frankly,
        <strong>BORING</strong>.  The %ergarcade% takes all that information
        from the %performance-monitor% and sends it to your computer where it
        can be manipulated to give you something highly entertaining!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="how-to-setup">
        <h2>Quick setup</h2>

        <ol>
            <Li>Connect your %concept2% %performance-monitor% to your computer.
            </li>
            <li>Download and install the %c2proxy%.
            </li>
            <li>From the %c2proxy% widget in the system tray of your computer, click <strong>Launch browser</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Choose from any of the %tools%, %visualisations% and %games% and start erging!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        For more information, including setting up for multiple ergs, check out the
        %detailed-setup% guide.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="how">
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>
        A small application, the <strong>%c2proxy%</strong>, is installed onto your computer.
        This acts as the middle-man between your ergometer(s) and your web browser - it will
        find all the ergometers connected to your computer, collect data from them as
        you row / bike / ski, and send it to your web browser which is displyaing a
        visualisation, showing a coaching tool or playing a game.
        </p>
        <p>
        More information about getting everything working can be found in the %detailed-setup% instructions.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="applications">
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
        All the applications available to you on the %ergarcade% are put into three broad groups.
        </p>

        <h3>%Tools%</h3>
        <p>
        The primary reason for the existance of the %ergarcade%. %Tools% include applications that
        improve both athlete and coaching experiences. A couple of examples:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>%omniscient%</strong> could be the coach's best friend, providing an unparallelled view into how
                each and every athlete in a group is performing, simultaneously, in real-time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>%bigview% </strong>gives as much information as possible on all connected ergometers. Again, all
                simultaneously, all in real-time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        More applications can be found in %tools%.
        </p>

        <h3>%Visualisations%</h3>
        <p>
        %Visualisations% give you something to look at and listen to whilst working on your erg.
        These are graphically beautiful, and reflect various information provided from the %performance-monitor%,
        such as cadence, watt, calories, stroke rate and more. A couple of cool %visualisations%:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>%webgl-fluid-simulation%</strong> is a lightweight fluid simulation that responds
                to the speed of your row, ski or pedal cadence.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        More trippy visuals can be found in %visualisations%.
        </p>

        <h3>%Games%</h3>
        <p>
        The ultimate motivator for spending time doing anything at all! The %games% section contains a
        treasure trove of fun stuff - all playable through your erg! A couple of highlights:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
        See the %games% section for all the fun stuff!
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="roadmap">
        <h2>Roadmap</h2>
        <p>
        The %ergarcade% is always getting new %tools%, %visualisations% and %games%. Development
        isn't adhoc though; there is a systematic approach to improving and adding to the %ergarcade%.
        Here are the top items from the roadmap:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Port %c2proxy% to Windows</li>
            <li>Port %c2proxy% to Linux</li>
            <li>RS485 support</li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        The %ergarcade% is free for you to use without limitation. Use it at home, in the gym or
        in your erging studio. However, building all the %visualisations%, %tools% and %games%
        takes resources, skill and time. If you use the %ergarcade% and like it, and want to see
        more cool stuff, please consider donating to %ergarcade-patreon%. As a patron you will:

        <h2>Author</h2>
        <p>
        <strong>Dean Fogarty</strong> is a software engineer, %concept2-coach% and CrossFit coach
        based in Brisbane, Australia. He came up with the idea of the Erg Arcade after deciding
        the data the %concept2% %performance-monitor% collects can be used in a variety of ways to
        improve training on the erg, both for the individual athlete and the coach.
        </p>

        <p>
        The initial application was %omniscient%, a single web page application that allows a
        rowing coach to view the performance of multiple ergometers simultaneously which proved
        very useful in a class situation. From there, %bigview% was next which supplemented
        %omniscient%. Visualisations were next, starting with a port of %webgl-fluid-simulation% by
        <a href="https://github.com/PavelDoGreat">Pavel Dobryakov</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Dean enjoys coaching the erg, CrossFit, and writing visualisations. He is very busy as
        a husband to Shannon and father to Thea, Ariel and Atlas. He can be contacted via email
        at <a href="mailto:dean@makingmuscle.com.au">dean@makingmuscle.com.au</a>.
