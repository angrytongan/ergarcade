    <h1>Welcome to the Erg Arcade!</h1>

    <p>
    The <strong>Erg Arcade</strong> makes training on any of the %concept2%
    ergometers - the indoor rower, the SkiErg or the BikeErg - much more
    enjoyable! Connect your ergometer to your computer and you can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use %tools% to improve your coaching and erging experience;</li>
        <li>Watch groovy %visualisations% while you train; and</li>
        <li>Play some awesome %games%!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    And unlike a real arcade, all the applications on the %ergarcade% are
    <strong>free to use!</strong>
    </p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>What is this, and why would I need it?</h2>
        <p>
        The %concept2% %performance-monitor% (<strong>PM</strong>) collects
        lots of information during an erg session which is useful in the
        context of training for improving health and fitness.  However,
        spending lots of time on the ergometer can be, frankly,
        <strong>BORING</strong>. Applications from the %ergarcade% use
        the same information to provide a much more entertaining erging
        experience!
        </p>

    <div id="how-to-setup">
        <h2>Quick setup</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Connect your %concept2% %performance-monitor% to your computer.
            </li>
            <li>Download and install the %c2proxy%.
            </li>
            <li>From the %c2proxy% widget in the system tray of your computer,
                click <strong>Launch browser</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>Choose from any of the %tools%, %visualisations% and %games%
                and start erging!
            </li>
        </ol>
