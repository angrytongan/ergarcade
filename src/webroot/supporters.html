    <p>
    The %ergarcade% is completely free for you to use in whatever setting you
    choose - at home, at the gym or in your rowing / skiing / biking studio!
    However, building, testing and delivering all the %tools%, %visualisations%
    and %games% takes time and resources. If you like the %ergarcade% and want
    to see more cool stuff, please consider becoming a patron and committing to
    a small monthly donation to fund development.
