    <h1>Applications</h1>

    <p>
    There are three types of applications available on the %ergarcade% -
    %tools%, %visualisations% and %games%. All of them utilise information
    generated by the %concept2% %performance-monitor% whilst rowing, skiing and
    biking. None of them interfere with any function of the
    %performance-monitor%, so you can use %ergarcade% applications at the same
    time as using apps like %ergdata%.
    </p>

    <h2>%Tools%</h2>
    <p>
    %Tools% are useful for individual athletes and coaches. Observers are able
    to identify issues in rowing stroke, synchronisation between athletes and
    maintain a bird's eye view of a class. The top three useful tools:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Tool one</li>
        <li>Tool two</li>
        <li>Tool three</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    See all the tools in the %tools% section.
    </p>

    <h2>%Visualisations%</h2>
    <p>
    %Visualisations% allow the athlete to break the monotony of training while
    still remaining engaged during the workout. Visualisations are simple
    interactive movies that respond to your erging technique - cadence, pace,
    output and more are used differently for different visualisations to provide
    an entertaining unique experience. Some sample visualisations:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Visualisation one</li>
        <li>Visualisation two</li>
        <li>Visualisation three</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    See all the visualisations in the %visualisations% section.
    </p>

    <h2>%Games%</h2>
    <p>
    Pure entertainment! Playing games while erging sounds silly, but actually
    works really well! The latest three games:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Game one</li>
        <li>Game two</li>
        <li>Game three</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    See all the games in the %games% section.
