<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>
%Applications% on the %ergarcade% connect your computer to your %concept2%
%performance-monitor% ether via Bluetooth or over USB. In the case of Bluetooth
connections, the data is collected directly by the application; for USB
connections, an intermediate application called %c2proxy% must be installed on
your computer.
</p>

<p>
Make sure to read the requirements and configuration notes on each application,
as these detail the correct setup procedure and environment required.
