<h2>Author</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://df.id.au" target="_blank">Dean Fogarty</a> is a semi-retired software engineer
based in Brisbane, Australia. After spending a significant amount of time
training on the %concept2% rower, and becoming frustrated that there weren't
any applications that made training engaging, entertaining or fun, he came up
with the idea of the %ergarcade% as a way to improve the training experience.
</p>

<p>
When not sitting on the rower, Dean can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a>
lurking in <a target="_blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/crossfit">r/crossfit</a>. Feel free
to %df-reddit-contact him there%</a>.

<h3>Custom works</h3>
<p>
If you are after a custom application, tool or visualisation that uses the %concept2%
family of ergometers, and can't find it on the %ergarcade%, please %df-reddit-get in touch%
and I'll see what I can do.
