        CrossFit coach based in Brisbane, Australia. He came up with the
        %ergarcade% after deciding the data collected by the %concept2%
        %performance-monitor% could be presented in various forms that would help
        coaches and athletes in real-time.

        Dean enjoys coaching the erg, training and coaching CrossFit, and writing

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
        The initial application was %omniscient%, a single web page application
        that shows a group of athletes performance monitors simultaneously
        and in real-time. Paired with a tablet, coaches were now able to coach
        individual athletes while watching data from the entire group, without
        leaving the gym floor.

        Visualisations were next, starting with a port of %webgl-fluid-simulation%
        by <a href="https://github.com/PavelDoGreat">Pavel Dobryakov</a>.
        Experiments with the %unity% game engine led to <i>this</i> and <i>that</i> games.
