        <h2>Single user setup</h2>
        <p>
        The most common setup will be when you are training on your own. You'll need:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>A %concept2% indoor rower, SkiErg or BikeErg.</strong> %ergarcade%
                specifically uses the %concept2% %performance-monitor% and won't function
                with any other monitor.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A USB A-to-B cable.</strong> Also referred to as a USB printer cable,
                or just printer cable, this cord has a flat USB connector at one end and a
                square-ish connector at the other. Cables should be no longer than 5 metres
                in length.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A computer running Mac OS X.</strong> This can be a
                desktop or laptop computer and must have a USB port available.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Putting everything together:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Power on your computer.</li>
            <li>Plug the flat end of the USB cable into your computer / laptop.</li>
            <li>Plug the square-ish end of the USB cable into your %performance-monitor%.
                This can be found on the underside of the monitor (PM4) or the rear (PM5).
            </li>
            <li>Download and install the %c2proxy% application on your computer.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        Once %c2proxy% has been installed, it will appear in the system tray of
        your computer. Clicking on the %c2proxy% icon will show your connected
        ergometer. Click on <strong>Launch browser</strong> will take you to
        the %ergarcade% website where you can choose from a range of %tools%,
        %visualisations% or %games% to play!

        <h2>Multi-user setup</h2>
        <p>
        Multi-user setups are for class or gym environments, when you want to
        have a birds' eye view across all athletes at the same time. You'll
        need:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Multiple %concept2% indoor rowers, SkiErgs or BikeErgs.</strong>
                %ergarcade% specifically uses the %concept2%
                %performance-monitor% and won't function with any other
                monitor. You can mix and match rowers, SkiErgs or BikeErgs as
                well.
            </li>
            <li><strong>One USB A-to-B cable per ergometer.</strong> Also
                referred to as a USB printer cable, or just printer cable, this
                cord has a flat USB connector at one end and a square-ish
                connector at the other. Cables should be no longer than 5
                metres in length.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A powered USB hub.</strong> A USB hub has multiple USB
                ports, allowing you to plug in multiple cables that go to your
                ergometers and only take up one USB port on your computer. The
                USB hub should be powered; non-powered hubs will not function
                correctly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A computer running Mac OS X.</strong> This can be a
                desktop or laptop computer and must have a USB port available.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Putting everything together:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Power on your computer.</li>
            <li>Plug the flat end of the USB hub cable into your computer /
                laptop. Turn the power on to the hub.
            </li>
            <li>Plug in one USB cable per port on the USB hub. Plug the other
                end of each of these cables (the square-ish connector) to each
                ergometer %performance-monitor%; these can be found on the
                underside of the monitor (PM4) or the rear (PM5).
            </li>
            <li>Download and install the %c2proxy% application on your computer.</li>

    <div id="remote-viewing" name="remote-viewing">
        <h2>Remote Viewing</h2>
        <p>
        Remote viewing allows devices other than your computer to run
        %ergarcade% applications and gather ergometer data from your computer.
        An example would be a coaching situation where you have a
        <a href="#multi-user-setup">multi-user setup</a> and are using %omniscient%
        on a tablet or phone to watch all your athlete's force curves while moving
        around and critiquing form.
        </p>

        <p>
        Once you have your environment setup (either <a href="#single-user-setup">single</a>
        or <a href="#multi-user-setup">multi</a>):
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Click on the %c2proxy% icon in the system tray of your computer, and
                note the <strong>address</strong> field. This will be a string of four
                numbers separated with periods, a colon, and another number.
            </li>
            <li>On your remote device, open your web browser to %ergarcade% and open
                your chosen application.
            </li>
            <li>Once loaded, go to the configuration section of the application, and in
                the <strong>Server</strong> field enter the value you noted above.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        The %ergarcade% application on your remote device will be connected to your computer.

        <h2>Casting</h2>
        <p>
        Casting is the ability for a computer to send it's video output to another
        screen, such as a television or smart monitor. This can be very useful in
        a class environment, allowing all athletes to see performance simultaneously
        as well as play some multi-user %games%.
        <p>

        <p>
        While casting is not built-into %ergarcade%, you can absolutely install casting
        software on your computer and have your screen sent to another device.
        </p>

        <p>
        Consult the documentation that came with your casting hardware or software.
