            <p class="centre">
            On the BikeErg, the same RPM at different damper settings alters
            pace, power and calories per hour reported on the PM5. In this
            article we provide charts showing these relationships at
            damper settings 10, 8, 6, 4 and 2.

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
        Starting at damper 10, 2:00 of work was completed on the BikeErg with
        the athlete holding as close as possible to 30RPM. This was repeated for
        40RPM, 50RPM and 60RPM.
        </p>
        <p>
        This set of workouts was repeated at damper 8 and 6. It was also
        repeated for dampers 4 and 2, but using 40RPM, 50RPM, 60RPM and 70RPM,
        as 30RPM did not yield accurate paces.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The BikeErg used in testing was brand new.</li>
            <li>The BikeErg was calibrated prior to starting the workouts.</li>
            <li>The flywheel cage was clean before starting the workouts.</li>
            <li>At damper 10, the PM5 showed a drag factor of 215.</li>
            <li>At damper 1, the PM5 showed a drag factor of 37.</li>
            <li>Data recorded at 15m above sea level.</li>
            <li>Each work piece was recorded by ErgData and uploaded to the <a
                    href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2 logbook</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
        <h2>Collation</h2>
        <p>
        Each damper-rpm workout combination (eg. damper 10 RPM 30, damper 10 RPM
        40 etc) was pulled from the Concept2 logbook, along with per stroke
        (per-revolution) data. For each combination, any revolution not matching
        the target RPM was removed, leaving only revolutions that matched our
        target RPM. The average pace for each target RPM was calculated, giving a
        damper-rpm-pace tuple.
        </p>
        <p>
        Power and calories per hour were calculated based on the formulas for

        The <a target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares">least-squares</a>
        regression method was applied to each damper setting group of RPM-pace,
        RPM-power and RPM-calories per hour combination to yield functions for
        each, which are plotted in the charts at the top of this page.

        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p>
        The graphs presented above are based on results recorded on a single
        machine (<i>n</i> = 1). Your may see different results on your own
        BikeErg due to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Different amount of flywheel dust or debris which alters drag
                factor;</li>
            <li>Air pressure differences, notably from differing altitudes,
                again impacting drag factor;</li>
            <li>Differing amounts of wear on machines; or</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.concept2.com/service/bikeerg/maintenance">Differing
