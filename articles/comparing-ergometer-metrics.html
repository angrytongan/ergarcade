            <h1>Comparing Ergometer Metrics</h1>

            <hr />

            <p class="centre">
            Comparing performance metrics like pace and distance across
            ergometers is difficult. In this article we examine using power as
            the base from which to equate other metrics.
            </p>
        </div>

        <hr />
        <h2>The problem</h2>
        <p>
        There is no standard construction for an ergometer. Manufacturers choose
        their own design, materials, build and assembly processes. This lack of
        standardisation extends to the values displayed on the ergometer
        monitor: one manufacturer will show different values to another for the
        same input from the user.
        </p>

        <p>
        Here, we propose power to equate ergometers, and why this is closer than
        any other metric.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>A possible solution</h2>
        <p>
        <i><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)">Power</a></i>
        is the amount of work that has occurred over a period of time. We are
        going to assume that <i>if one ergometer records the same amount of work
        as another ergometer, over the same period of time, they are
        equivalent measures, irrespective of how that work was completed or
        calculated</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, if one bike ergometer takes 1 pedal rotation to generate 1
        watt of power, and another takes 2 pedal rotations to generate 1 watt of
        power, we say they are doing the same amount of work over the same
        amount of time even though the mechanical action is different. This
        yields a naive formula of:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
            Erg<sub>A</sub> 1RPM = Erg<sub>B</sub> 2RPM = 1W
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        This assumption removes any dependency on specific hardware or software
        characteristics. We equate a watt recorded on one machine as the same as
        on another machine.
        </p>

        <p>
        Before we delve further into the methods for comparing ergometers using
        power, let's examine the links between displayed metrics on a single
        ergometer first.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Relationships between metrics</h2>
        <p>
        Ergometers may have a non-linear relationship between a physical action
        and a metric displayed on the monitor. For example, air-resistance
        ergometers that use a flywheel have a
        <a
            target="_blank"
            href="http://eodg.atm.ox.ac.uk/user/dudhia/rowing/physics/ergometer.html#section3">cubic
            relationship between power and velocity</a>. Some relationships
        are linear, such as RPM and distance.
        </p>

        <p>
        The exact method of how to generate the relationship between action and
        displayed metric are beyond the scope of this proposal, as the number of
        variables involved is substantial and their relationships may be
        complex. Rather than attempt to discern the exact mathematics used by
        each manufacturer, we will base our calculations by the simpler method
        of collecting metrics for various user inputs.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Metric collection</h2>
        <p>
        We collect these metrics through two methods: derivation and observation.
        </p>

        <h3>Derived metrics</h3>
        <p>
        Some manufacturers, such as <a href="https://www.concept2.com">Concept2</a>,
        publish their math for calculating metrics. These can be in the
        form of <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/pace-calculator">calculators</a>,
        <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.concept2.com/files/pdf/us/training/Training_PaceChart.pdf">tables</a>
        and <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/calculators/watts-calculator">formulas</a>.
            For example, Concept2 calculate power as:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Power<sub>watts</sub> = 2.8 / (split/500)<sup>3</sup>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        where <i>split</i> is pace over a set distance.
        </p>

        <p>
        So, using this formula, for any given pace, we are able to derive the
        value of power and place those values on a graph:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-c2-power-curve"></div>

        <p>
        Not all manufacturers provide such information. We need another method.
        </p>

        <h3>Observed metrics</h3>
        <p>
        We consider an observed metric to be the value of a metric displayed on
        an ergometers' monitor for discrete input values. For example, on the
        Assault Air Bike, we can sample the value of power at particular speeds:
        </p>
        <table style="margin: 0 auto;">
            <tr>
                <th>Speed on monitor (kph)</th>
                <th>Power on monitor (W)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>12.3</td><td>21</td>
            <tr><td>24.6</td><td>99</td>
            <tr><td>37.0</td><td>288</td>
            <tr><td>47.5</td><td>579</td>
        </table>

        <p>
        Converting speed to pace, we now have pace versus power:
        </p>

        <table style="margin: 0 auto;">
            <tr>
                <th>Calculated Pace (/1000m)</th>
                <th>Power on monitor (W)</th>
            </tr>
            <tr><td>4:52</td><td>21</td>
            <tr><td>2:26</td><td>99</td>
            <tr><td>1:37</td><td>288</td>
            <tr><td>1:15</td><td>579</td>
        </table>

        <p>
        We can then plot pace versus power:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-aab-power-observed"></div>

        <p>
        From these raw points, we can generate a <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting">best-fit
            curve</a> from which we can use to derive values of power for all
        our values of pace:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-aab-power-derived"></div>

        <hr />
        <h2>Comparing ergometers</h2>
        <p>
        Overlaying different plots of different ergometers' metrics gives us a
        quick and dirty way to compare using the common base of power:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-cmp-aab-c2-pace-power"></div>
        <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: An athlete completes 1000m on the Concept2 BikeErg
        in 1:40.0. What would the equivalent pace be on the Assault Air Bike to
        equate it to the BikeErg?
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: We need to look up the work done on the BikeErg at
        1:40, and apply it to the Assault Air Bike curve to determine equivalent
        pace.  1:40 on the Concept2 curve of the graph is 349W. We can now look
        along the curve for the Assault Air Bike for 349W; the nearest value is
        346W, at a pace of 1:31. So, the equivalent pace on the Assault Air Bike
        is between 1:30 and 1:31.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>A lot of data collection</h2>
        <p>
        Lacking sufficient derived metric formulas and math provided by
        manufacturers, observed metrics would be the easiest way to collect all
        required values in order to provide a means to compare many ergometers.
        This method is time intensive, as accurate and repeatable measurements
        must be made for a range of user inputs on the device.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, performing the collection would allow us to determine
        relationships between:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rotations per minute / strokes per minute;</li>
            <li>Distance;</li>
            <li>Power;</li>
            <li>Speed / pace;</li>
            <li>Calories per hour;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        and so on, not only on one ergometer type, but across ergometers from
        different manufacturers.
        </p>

        <p>
        By equating metrics between ergometers, workout providers would be able
        to more easily provide scalings based on device metrics rather than just
        feel. For example, calories as a target on two different ergometers will
        be different, but given the right amount of data, these targets could
        now be calculated more accurately than by feel.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Accuracy concerns</h2>
        <p>
        Derived metrics are mathematically correct, so on paper our values would
        be highly accurate. However, in the real world these values may vary
        significantly. Similarly, observed metrics have their own issues and
        deficiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Manufacturing tolerances</h3>
        <p>
        Mass producing any machine requires balancing accuracy and precision
        against budget and marketability. Decisions made during design may
        lower tolerances during construction, yielding machines that differ from
        each other even though they may be built in the same location or even in
        the same batch. These differences may manifest as slightly different
        metrics for the same inputs.
        </p>

        <h3>Dampers</h3>
        <p>
        Some machines include a <i>damper</i>, which is used to adjust the
        measured rate of deceleration after an act of exertion by the athlete on
        the ergometer. The mechanism for damping could be adjustable air intake,
        friction or magnetic brake.
        </p>
        <p>
        Adjustable dampers won't affect relationships based on power, but will
        affect metrics like RPM and speed. For these metrics, curves for each
        damper setting will need to be generated.
        </p>

        <h3>Wear</h3>
        <p>
        Product wear may impact operation and reporting of accurate figures. For
        example, air-based ergometers accumulate dust in the flywheel cage, and
        change the amount of air entering, altering the amount of drag the vanes
        experience. This will affect damper-based metrics.
        </p>

        <h3>Sample points</h3>
        <p>
        For observed metrics, a small number of samples will not generate highly
        accurate curves. For example, 4 points were used in the above graph for
        the Assault Air Bike over a small range of pace. The curve that resulted 
        varies significantly to the original points at higher paces.
        </p>

        <h3>Environmental issues</h3>
        <p>
        The environment that an ergometer is used in could drastically change
        the metrics it reports. For example, ergometers that use air for
        resistance will operate differently at higher altitudes than at sea
        level, due to the change in air pressure.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        If we consider power to be equal across ergometers, it's possible to
        obtain, either through derivation or observation, metrics from different
        erogmeters that we can compare to equate different types of machines.
