            <hr />

            <p class="centre">
            Through the <a href="https://concept2.com/ergdata">ErgData</a>
            application, it's possible to record and review stroke / revolution data
            from a Concept2 ergometer. Below we capture and analyse pieces performed on the
            BikeErg at different damper settings.
            </p>
        </div>

        <hr />
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>
        We want to see the effect that damper setting has on pace at a given RPM
        on the BikeErg. An in-depth discussion of damper setting and drag factor
        is beyond the scope of this experiment; Concept2 has an excellent <a
            href="https://www.concept2.com/indoor-rowers/training/tips-and-general-info/damper-setting-101">article
        describing what damper is, what drag factor is, what they are not, and what damper to use</a>.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>
        Starting at damper 10, 2:00 of work would be completed on the BikeErg
        and recorded by ErgData.  The athlete would try to get as high an RPM as
        possible over the 2:00, but not hold any particular RPM. This allows us
        to accumulate data mapping RPM to pace over a range at a given damper.
        </p>
        <p>
        This would be done 10 times; the first at damper 10, the second at
        damper 9 and so on until damper 1.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The BikeErg used was less than a year old.</li>
            <li>The flywheel cage was clean before starting the experiment.</li>
            <li>At damper 10, the BikeErg Performance Monitor (PM) showed a drag
                factor of 220.</li>
            <li>At damper 1, the PM showed a drag factor of 49.</li>
            <li>Data recorded at 13m above sea level.</li>
            <li>Two athletes alternated between work pieces.</li>
            <li>Each work piece was recorded by ErgData and uploaded to the <a
                    href="https://log.concept2.com">Concept2 logbook</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
        Each work piece was pulled from the Concept2 logbook, along with
        per-stroke (per-revolution) data. Raw data is available <a
            href="/js/charts/bikeerg-damper-tests.js">here</a>. Erroneously
        recorded values (value too high, recorded pace invalid with associated
        RPM etc) are commented out of the dataset.
        </p>
        <p>
        Each damper setting graph series in each graph below is labeled
        <i>D&lt;num&gt;</i>, where <i>&lt;num&gt;</i> is the number the damper
        was set on.
        </p>
        <p>
        Tap each series label in each graph's legend to disable / enable the
        series on the graph.  Mouse-over or tap the graph to see values of pace
        for each damper at a given RPM.
        </p>

        <h3>Raw data, cleaned</h3>
        <p>
        The raw data was cleaned, with repeated pace/RPM values aggregated to a
        single data point to remove noise. At this point, it is possible to
        infer the trajectories of RPM-pace pairs resembling curves.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bikeerg-damper-tests-cleaned"></div>

        <h3>Joining the dots</h3>
        <p>
        By plotting each series as a line, we can see a non-linear relationship
        between pace and RPM. We can also see that a higher damper setting
        yields a faster pace at the same RPM for all recorded RPM.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example: at damper 1, an RPM of 80 gives a pace of 2:23.9. At damper
        10, an RPM of 80 gives a pace of 1:28.0.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bikeerg-damper-tests-connected"></div>

        <h3>Averaging out</h3>
        <p>
        Passing a cumulative average function across each dataset helps reduce
        bumps, at the cost of reducing accuracy. However, this reinforces our
        previous observation relating pace, RPM and damper.
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bikeerg-damper-tests-cumulative-average"></div>

        <hr />
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        While our observation that a higher damper setting at a particular RPM
        yields a faster pace is not revolutionary (no pun intended), it is
        interesting to see the effect that damper has across a range of damper
        settings.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that a dusty flywheel or air pressure changes due to altitude will
        generate different values to the ones documented above.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Flaws</h2>
        <h3>Collection method</h3>
        <p>
        The methodology of having the athlete cover a range of RPM for 2:00 was
        flawed. Naturally, the athletes increased from idle to a
        &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; RPM over a short period of time, stayed at
        that RPM, and then increased RPM nearing the end of the 2:00.
        </p>
        <p>
        This gave a larger variance of pace at low and high RPM, which may skew
        the results.
        </p>
        <p>
        A better approach would be to select a set of RPM values (perhaps 30, 40,
        50, 60, 70, 80) and have the athlete hold that RPM for a set amount of
        time before moving to the next. This way we collect a greater number of
        points at each known RPM, reducing jitter.
        </p>

        <h3>Incorrect Drag Factor?</h3>
        <p>
        Drag factor should follow damper setting to some degree; a lower damper
        setting is a lower drag factor, higher damper setting is a higher drag
        factor. However, the test for damper 10 showed a drag factor lower
        than damper 9, 8, and 7:
        </p>
        <div id="graph-bikeerg-damper-tests-drag-factors"></div>
        <p>
        Unsure what happened here.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <h2>Future work</h2>
        <p>
        It would be nice to re-run this and generate some more accurate data.
        This would increase accuracy of our damper curves to allow better
        comparisons between RPM and pace.
        </p>
